Through this review, we have tried to reveal different types of interfacing technique between human and machine to exhibit the evolution of the related technologies in developing assistant devices. This review explores the contemporary groundbreaking technologies developed for this purpose and their advantages and limitations. An outline is drawn for forthcoming development in the field of human machine interaction, human computer interaction and human robot interaction by using this review. This review draws a broad perspective on status quo and perspective on the possible future development of interfaces of assistant devices in the field of Human machine interaction.},

In many fields of application software system development, experts have listed man–machine interface as one of the commands for the urgent research and advancement. This article has proposed the improvement to the man–machine interface system control design for the practical value of life, and has presented an approach for algorithms using Machine Learning. The method used in the paper includes the spatial layout of human–machine interface supported by the design cognition model and the use of Machine Learning algorithms. Based on Max–Min Ant System, the optimal path of ant construction is obtained, which is the optimal layout scheme. The experimental result in the paper shows that: with the support of the cognitive model, the cabin man–machine interface system control design method based on Genetic Algorithm-Ants Algorithm is obtained. The layout design principles were summarized by the cognitive model, and the layout optimization objective function was constructed according to each principle, and the problem of solving layout parties and cases was transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem. The form of fitness function, pheromone, and heuristic information for layout optimization was studied, and the algorithm of manual optimization process was implemented based on Genetic Algorithm and Ant Algorithm, in order to obtain a good optimization performance and time performance as a result. The practical value of the control design of man–machine interface system with the Machine Learning algorithm is proved.},

  abstract  = {This article presents a rehabilitation technique based on a lower-limb exoskeleton integrated with a human-machine interface (HMI). HMI is used to record and process multimodal signals collected using a foot motor imagery (MI)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) and multichannel electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from leg muscles. Current solutions of HMI-equipped rehabilitation assistive technologies tested under laboratory conditions demonstrated a great deal of success, but faced several difficulties caused by the limited accuracy of detecting MI electroencephalography (EEG) and the reliability of online control when executing a movement by patients dressed in an exoskeleton. In the case of lower-limb representation, there is still the problem of reliably distinguishing leg movement intentions and differentiating them in BMI systems. Targeting the design of a rehabilitation technique replicating the natural mode of motor control in exoskeleton walking patients, we have shown how the combined use of multimodal signals can improve the accuracy, performance, and reliability of HMI. The system was tested on healthy subjects operating the exoskeleton under different conditions. The study also resulted in algorithms of multimodal HMI data collection, processing, and classification. The developed system can analyze up to 15 signals simultaneously in real-time during a movement. Foot MI is extracted from EEG signals (seven channels) using the event-related (de)synchronization effect. Supplemented by EMG signals reflecting motor intention, the control system can initiate and differentiate the movement of the right and left legs with a high degree of reliability. The classification and control system permits one to work online when the exoskeleton is executing a movement.},
