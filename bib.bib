- This paper is about the quality of service prediction for autonomous system. The QoS is defined as latency, coverage, data rate (downlink/uplink)
- The prediction focuses on the objective of the prediction, whether the QoS KPIs are fulfilled, the PQoS window, the appropriate reactions 
- The PQoS should allow the application to continue operation with adapted functionality under upcoming QoS conditions. The IoTs and V2X applications are dicussed. 
- This papers also trains a DNN using SINR and location and/or SINR in simulation to predict the data rate. 

Merits:
- This papers gives a good overview of the current state of the art/technology in PQoS

Drawbacks:
- As a survey paper, it does not give a good direction for future research
- The contribution of the DNN is minimal},

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},
