  year       = {2022},
  abstract   = {With the wide penetration of smart robots in multi-
farious fields, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
technique in robotics has attracted growing attention in the
community. Yet collaborating SLAM over multiple robots still
remains challenging due to performance contradiction between
the intensive graphics computation of SLAM and the limited
computing capability of robots. While traditional solutions resort
to the powerful cloud servers acting as an external computation
provider, we show by real-world measurements that the signif-
icant communication overhead in data offloading prevents its
practicability to real deployment. To tackle these challenges,
this paper promotes the emerging edge computing paradigm (a) Example apartment scene (b) The corresponding map gen-
into multi-robot SLAM and proposes RecSLAM, a multi-robot with ten robots. erated by RecSLAM.},
