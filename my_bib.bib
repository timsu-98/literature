  abstractnote = {The growing demand of industrial, automotive and service robots presents a challenge to the centralized Cloud Robotics model in terms of privacy, security, latency, bandwidth, and reliability. In this paper, we present a ‘Fog Robotics’ approach to deep robot learning that distributes compute, storage and networking resources between the Cloud and the Edge in a federated manner. Deep models are trained on non-private (public) synthetic images in the Cloud; the models are adapted to the private real images of the environment at the Edge within a trusted network and subsequently, deployed as a service for low-latency and secure inference/prediction for other robots in the network. We apply this approach to surface decluttering, where a mobile robot picks and sorts objects from a cluttered floor by learning a deep object recognition and a grasp planning model. Experiments suggest that Fog Robotics can improve performance by sim-to-real domain adaptation in comparison to exclusively using Cloud or Edge resources, while reducing the inference cycle time by 4 to successfully declutter 86% of objects over 213 attempts.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of mobile internet services has yielded a variety of computatiWred as an efficient approach to relieve the heavy computational burdens and realize an efficient computation offloading. Driven by the consequent requirement for proper resource allocations for computation offloading via MEC, in this paper, we propose a Deep-Q Network (DQN) based task offloading and resource allocation algorithm for the MEC. Specifically, we consider a MEC system in which every mobile terminal has multiple tasks offloaded to the edge server and design a joint task offloading decision and bandwidth allocation optimization to minimize the overall offloading cost in terms of energy cost, computation cost, and delay cost. Although the proposed optimization problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming in nature, we exploit an emerging DQN technique to solve it. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed DQN-based approach can achieve the near-optimal performance.},

IoT is expected to connect billions of devices and humans to bring promising advantages for us. With this growth, fog computing, along with its related edge computing paradigms, such as multi-access edge computing (MEC) and cloudlet, are seen as promising solutions for handling the large volume of security-critical and time-sensitive data that is being produced by the IoT. In this paper, we first provide a tutorial on fog computing and its related computing paradigms, including their similarities and differences. Next, we provide a taxonomy of research topics in fog computing, and through a comprehensive survey, we summarize and categorize the efforts on fog computing and its related computing paradigms. Finally, we provide challenges and future directions for research in fog computing.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a method to enable a robot using stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) to achieve high performance on a repetitive path-following task. In particular, we consider the case where the accuracy of the model for robot dynamics varies significantly over the path–motivated by the fact that the models used in MPC must be computationally efficient, which limits their expressive power. Our approach is based on correcting the cost predicted using a simple learned dynamics model over the MPC horizon. This discourages the controller from taking actions that lead to higher cost than would have been predicted using the dynamics model. In addition, stochastic MPC provides a quantitative measure of safety by limiting the probability of violating state and input constraints over the prediction horizon. Our approach is unique in that it combines both online model learning and cost learning over the prediction horizon and is geared towards operating a robot in changing conditions. We demonstrate our algorithm in simulation and experiment on a ground robot that uses a stereo camera for localization.},

  abstract = {Lagrangian systems represent a wide range of robotic systems, including manipulators, wheeled and legged robots, and quadrotors. Inverse dynamics control and feed-forward linearization techniques are typically used to convert the complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled double integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to calculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system. However, these methods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is often not available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the literature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not provide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control system. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the closed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate the error between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the system, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an upper bound on the uncertainty of the linearized model. This uncertainty bound is then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the overall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our approach via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator and experimentally on a 6 DOF industrial manipulator.},

- This paper is about the quality of service prediction for autonomous system. The QoS is defined as latency, coverage, data rate (downlink/uplink)
- The prediction focuses on the objective of the prediction, whether the QoS KPIs are fulfilled, the PQoS window, the appropriate reactions 
- The PQoS should allow the application to continue operation with adapted functionality under upcoming QoS conditions. The IoTs and V2X applications are dicussed. 
- This papers also trains a DNN using SINR and location and/or SINR in simulation to predict the data rate. 

Merits:
- This papers gives a good overview of the current state of the art/technology in PQoS

Drawbacks:
- As a survey paper, it does not give a good direction for future research
- The contribution of the DNN is minimal},

- The agent is deployed at the base station side with the action space that controls all the vehicles connected to the base station
- The actions of the agent is how to compress the LiDAR data. The more compressed the data are, the higher the error is.

Merits:
- The methodology is well explained

Drawbacks:
- The experiment is not clearly explained},

In order to meet the special requirements of highly mobile vehicles, communication must take place via cellular networks. However, cellular networks are subject to potential fluctuations in their performance, which can have a negative impact on the remote control. In this thesis, we address this network issue, examine its implications and present possible solutions.},

The Internet provides new possibilities for universities and other teaching organizations to share laboratories and increase the number of lab sessions without incurring any increase in cost. Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden has opened a traditional electronics laboratory for remote operation and control 24/7; it is the first of its kind. The laboratory is equipped with a unique virtual interface enabling students to recognize on their own computer screen the desktop instruments and the breadboard they have already used in the local laboratory. The research is focused on what is perceived to be the greatest challenge, i.e. to give the student laboratory experience that is as genuine as possible despite the lack of direct contact with the actual lab hardware at the same time as it allows the teacher to use existing equipment and teaching material. The goal is to produce an open international standard.},

Although an abundance of frameworks have been emerged to make the interaction between human and machine easy and robust, a substantial portion of these is not flourished in their scope. Through this review, we have tried to reveal different types of interfacing technique between human and machine to exhibit the evolution of the related technologies in developing assistant devices. This review explores the contemporary groundbreaking technologies developed for this purpose and their advantages and limitations. An outline is drawn for forthcoming development in the field of human machine interaction, human computer interaction and human robot interaction by using this review. This review draws a broad perspective on status quo and perspective on the possible future development of interfaces of assistant devices in the field of Human machine interaction.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, progressive attention has been paid to the research of man–machine interface. In many fields of application software system development, experts have listed man–machine interface as one of the commands for the urgent research and advancement. This article has proposed the improvement to the man–machine interface system control design for the practical value of life, and has presented an approach for algorithms using Machine Learning. The method used in the paper includes the spatial layout of human–machine interface supported by the design cognition model and the use of Machine Learning algorithms. Based on Max–Min Ant System, the optimal path of ant construction is obtained, which is the optimal layout scheme. The experimental result in the paper shows that: with the support of the cognitive model, the cabin man–machine interface system control design method based on Genetic Algorithm-Ants Algorithm is obtained. The layout design principles were summarized by the cognitive model, and the layout optimization objective function was constructed according to each principle, and the problem of solving layout parties and cases was transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem. The form of fitness function, pheromone, and heuristic information for layout optimization was studied, and the algorithm of manual optimization process was implemented based on Genetic Algorithm and Ant Algorithm, in order to obtain a good optimization performance and time performance as a result. The practical value of the control design of man–machine interface system with the Machine Learning algorithm is proved.},

  abstract  = {This article presents a rehabilitation technique based on a lower-limb exoskeleton integrated with a human-machine interface (HMI). HMI is used to record and process multimodal signals collected using a foot motor imagery (MI)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) and multichannel electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from leg muscles. Current solutions of HMI-equipped rehabilitation assistive technologies tested under laboratory conditions demonstrated a great deal of success, but faced several difficulties caused by the limited accuracy of detecting MI electroencephalography (EEG) and the reliability of online control when executing a movement by patients dressed in an exoskeleton. In the case of lower-limb representation, there is still the problem of reliably distinguishing leg movement intentions and differentiating them in BMI systems. Targeting the design of a rehabilitation technique replicating the natural mode of motor control in exoskeleton walking patients, we have shown how the combined use of multimodal signals can improve the accuracy, performance, and reliability of HMI. The system was tested on healthy subjects operating the exoskeleton under different conditions. The study also resulted in algorithms of multimodal HMI data collection, processing, and classification. The developed system can analyze up to 15 signals simultaneously in real-time during a movement. Foot MI is extracted from EEG signals (seven channels) using the event-related (de)synchronization effect. Supplemented by EMG signals reflecting motor intention, the control system can initiate and differentiate the movement of the right and left legs with a high degree of reliability. The classification and control system permits one to work online when the exoskeleton is executing a movement.},
