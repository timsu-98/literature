- This paper is about the quality of service prediction for autonomous system. The QoS is defined as latency, coverage, data rate (downlink/uplink)
- The prediction focuses on the objective of the prediction, whether the QoS KPIs are fulfilled, the PQoS window, the appropriate reactions 
- The PQoS should allow the application to continue operation with adapted functionality under upcoming QoS conditions. The IoTs and V2X applications are dicussed. 
- This papers also trains a DNN using SINR and location and/or SINR in simulation to predict the data rate. 

Merits:
- This papers gives a good overview of the current state of the art/technology in PQoS

Drawbacks:
- As a survey paper, it does not give a good direction for future research
- The contribution of the DNN is minimal},

  abstract = {This dataset contains network data recorded from the experimental vehicle EDGAR (Execellent Driving GARching) over a period of 3 months. The data within this dataset can be divided into two categories: the physical layer data and the application layer data. The physical layer data are recorded with the on-board 5G router and indicates the connection quality of the Radio Access Network (RAN). The application layer data is recorded using various software tools and indicates the End-to-End (E2E) connection quality between the EDGAR and the server on TUM campus.},
