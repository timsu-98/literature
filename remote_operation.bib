  abstract = {Physical experiments are indispensable for developing skills to deal with physical processes and instrumentation. The Internet provides new possibilities for universities and other teaching organizations to share laboratories and increase the number of lab sessions without incurring any increase in cost. Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden has opened a traditional electronics laboratory for remote operation and control 24/7; it is the first of its kind. The laboratory is equipped with a unique virtual interface enabling students to recognize on their own computer screen the desktop instruments and the breadboard they have already used in the local laboratory. The research is focused on what is perceived to be the greatest challenge, i.e. to give the student laboratory experience that is as genuine as possible despite the lack of direct contact with the actual lab hardware at the same time as it allows the teacher to use existing equipment and teaching material. The goal is to produce an open international standard.},
